# Team Name: OurSace

## Project Description
OurSpace is a simplistic nosolgic blast to the past social media website that takes users back to the days when MySpace was still at its peak. Our goal is to make a engaging social media that does't just mimic social media from the past, but improves on concept laid out almost 20 years ago.

- **Reporting Absence:** As long as the group memeber is able to keep in contact with the team through the discord, this should't be a problem.

### 2. Religious Holidays
- **Religious Holiday:** If a team member cannot attend a class or weekly meeting due to a major religious holiday, they should inform the team at least one week in advance. Recognized religious holidays are those officially acknowledged by the institution or widely practiced by the individual's religion.

### 3. Intentional Damage to Team's Work
- **Handling Damage:** If a team member intentionally damages or destroys the team's work, this will be treated as a serious violation of team trust. The issue will be escalated to the course instructor or relevant authority for appropriate action.

### 4. Modifying Another Member's Work
- **Guideline:** Before making any changes to another team member's work in the repository, the team member must:
  1. Discuss the proposed change with the original author.
  2. Ensure the change is documented and agreed upon by the author.
  3. If the author is unavailable, make a pull request or branch with clear comments and wait for approval before merging.
  
### 5. Language Policy
- **English:** All team communication will be conducted in English to ensure clarity and inclusivity.

### 6. Face Mask Policy
